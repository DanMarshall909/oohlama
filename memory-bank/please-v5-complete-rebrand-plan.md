# Please v5.0 - Complete Rebrand & Natural Language Interface

## Overview
Building on the successful modular architecture of v3.0 and planned enhancements of v4.0, Please v5.0 represents a complete transformation from "OohLama" to "Please" with a revolutionary natural language interface that makes AI-powered script generation feel like conversing with a polite assistant.

## 🎯 Core Philosophy
**"please list all files older than 10 years"** - Natural, conversational, polite, and delightfully silly interaction with AI.

**Silly Tone Examples:**
- **Success Messages**: 
  - "✨ Ta-da! Your script is ready and looking fabulous!"
  - "🎉 Boom! Script generated faster than you can say 'please and thank you!'"
  - "🦄 Your magical script has materialized! *chef's kiss*"
- **Error Messages**: 
  - "Oops! Something went sideways 🙃 (but don't worry, I still love you)"
  - "🤔 Hmm, that didn't work as planned. Let's try again, shall we?"
  - "💔 Aww shucks! The AI got confused (it happens to the best of us)"
- **Loading Messages**: 
  - "🎭 Teaching AI to be helpful... please hold while magic happens"
  - "🧙‍♂️ Conjuring your script from the digital ether..."
  - "🎪 Putting on a show for your script generation needs!"
- **Menu Options**: 
  - "🎪 What shall we do with this magnificent script?"
  - "🎯 Pick your adventure! What tickles your fancy?"
  - "🍎 Choose your own script adventure!"
- **Warnings**: 
  - "⚠️ Heads up, buttercup! This script might do something spicy"
  - "🚨 Hold your horses! This script has some sass"
  - "🌶️ Spicy script alert! Please handle with care"
- **Configuration**: 
  - "🔧 Let's get you all set up and ready to rock!"
  - "⚙️ Time to make Please work exactly how you like it!"
  - "🎨 Personalizing your Please experience... fancy!"
- **Help Messages**:
  - "🆘 Need a hand? I'm here to help you help yourself!"
  - "💡 Stuck? Don't worry, happens to everyone!"
  - "🤗 Let me show you the ropes!"

## 🚀 Major Changes

### 1. 🤔 Interactive Clarification System
**Objective:** Handle ambiguous requests intelligently by asking for clarification before generating scripts

**Ambiguity Detection:**
- **Vague terms**: "backup files" (which files? where to?)
- **Missing parameters**: "delete old files" (how old? which directory?)
- **Multiple interpretations**: "organize photos" (by date? by location? by type?)
- **Platform assumptions**: "install package" (which package manager?)
- **Scope uncertainty**: "clean up system" (what specifically to clean?)

**Clarification Features:**
- **Smart Questions**: AI generates relevant follow-up questions
- **Multiple Choice**: Offer common options when applicable
- **Examples**: Provide examples to clarify intent
- **Context Awareness**: Use active contexts to infer likely meanings
- **Progressive Refinement**: Ask one question at a time to avoid overwhelming

**Interactive Clarification Examples:**
```bash
# Ambiguous request
please backup my important files

# System response
🤔 I'd love to help you backup your files! Just need a few details:

📁 Which files would you like to backup?
  1. Documents folder
  2. Desktop files
  3. Photos and videos
  4. Specific folder (please specify)
  5. Let me choose the files

📍 Where should I backup them to?
  1. External drive
  2. Cloud storage (OneDrive, Google Drive, etc.)
  3. Network location
  4. Specific path (please specify)

Just tell me the numbers or describe what you'd prefer!
```

**Clarification Workflow:**
1. **Parse Request**: Analyze user input for ambiguous terms
2. **Identify Gaps**: Determine what information is missing
3. **Generate Questions**: Create friendly, specific clarification questions
4. **Collect Responses**: Handle user answers in natural language
5. **Confirm Understanding**: Summarize what will be done
6. **Generate Script**: Create script with clarified requirements

**Implementation:**
```go
type ClarificationSystem struct {
    AmbiguityDetector  *AmbiguityDetector
    QuestionGenerator  *QuestionGenerator
    ResponseParser     *ResponseParser
    ConversationState  *ConversationState
}

type AmbiguousRequest struct {
    OriginalText    string
    AmbiguousTerms  []AmbiguousTerm
    Questions       []ClarificationQuestion
    UserResponses   []string
    ResolvedRequest string
}

type ClarificationQuestion struct {
    Text            string
    Type            string  // multiple_choice, open_ended, yes_no
    Options         []string
    Required        bool
    Context         string
}
```

### 2. 🌍 Internationalization & Customization System
**Objective:** Centralize all user-facing strings for internationalization and tone customization

**Centralized Strings Architecture:**
- **Single Source**: All user-facing text in centralized location
- **Multiple Languages**: Support for different languages (English, Spanish, French, German, Japanese, etc.)
- **Tone Customization**: Users can choose between silly, professional, casual, or custom tones
- **Cultural Adaptation**: Culturally appropriate expressions and examples
- **Easy Translation**: Simple format for community translations

**Language Pack Structure:**

### 3. 🚨 Advanced Safety & Warning System
**Objective:** Proactively identify and visually highlight potentially dangerous commands in generated scripts

**Dangerous Command Detection:**
- **File System Operations**: `rm -rf`, `del /f /s /q`, `format`, `fdisk`
- **System Changes**: `sudo`, `chmod 777`, `reg delete`, registry modifications
- **Network Operations**: `curl | bash`, downloading and executing scripts
- **Process Management**: `kill -9`, `taskkill /f`, stopping critical services
- **Permission Changes**: `chown`, `takeown`, privilege escalation
- **Database Operations**: `DROP DATABASE`, `DELETE FROM` without WHERE
- **Package Management**: `npm install -g`, `pip install` from untrusted sources

**Visual Highlighting System:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# 🎯 Please Generated Script - Handle with care!

# ✅ SAFE: List directory contents
ls -la /home/user/documents

# 🚨 DANGER ZONE 🚨
# ⚠️  WARNING: This command will permanently delete files!
# ⚠️  IMPACT: Irreversible data loss possible
# ⚠️  REVIEW: Double-check the path before running
rm -rf /tmp/old_files/*

# 🟡 CAUTION: System modification
# ⚠️  WARNING: Changes system permissions
# ⚠️  IMPACT: May affect system security
sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/my-script

# ✅ SAFE: Display system information
uname -a
```

**Safety Levels:**
- **Paranoid**: Flag any command that modifies system state
- **Careful**: Flag destructive operations and privilege escalations
- **Balanced**: Flag irreversible operations and major system changes
- **Trusting**: Flag only catastrophically dangerous operations
- **Disabled**: No safety warnings (not recommended)

**Warning Categories:**
```go
type DangerLevel int

const (
    SAFE        DangerLevel = 0  // ✅ Green - Safe operations
    CAUTION     DangerLevel = 1  // 🟡 Yellow - System modifications
    WARNING     DangerLevel = 2  // 🟠 Orange - Potentially harmful
    DANGER      DangerLevel = 3  // 🔴 Red - Destructive operations
    CRITICAL    DangerLevel = 4  // 🚨 Red flashing - Catastrophic risk
)

type DangerousCommand struct {
    Pattern     string
    Level       DangerLevel
    Description string
    Impact      string
    Suggestion  string
    Platform    []string  // windows, linux, macos, all
}
```

**Safety Database:**
```json

      "impact": "Complete system destruction possible",
      "suggestion": "Specify exact paths, never use /* or /",
      "platform": ["linux", "macos"]
    },
    {
      "pattern": "format\\s+[c-z]:",
      "level": 4,
      "description": "Format disk drive",
      "impact": "Complete data loss on drive",
      "suggestion": "Use specific file deletion instead",
      "platform": ["windows"]
    },
    {
      "pattern": "curl\\s+.*\\|.*sh",
      "level": 3,
      "description": "Download and execute script",
      "impact": "Arbitrary code execution from internet",
      "suggestion": "Download first, inspect, then execute manually",
      "platform": ["all"]
    },

      "suggestion": "Use specific permissions like 755 or 644",
      "platform": ["linux", "macos"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Visual Warning System:**
- **Script Comments**: Inline warnings with emoji and clear descriptions
- **Terminal Output**: Color-coded danger levels during script display
- **Interactive Prompts**: Require explicit confirmation for dangerous operations
- **Summary Report**: List all dangerous commands found before execution
- **Audit Log**: Record when dangerous scripts are generated and run

**Safety Commands:**
```bash
# Safety Configuration
please set safety level paranoid      # Set maximum safety level
please set safety level balanced      # Default safety level
please show safety settings          # Display current safety configuration
please scan script file.sh           # Scan existing script for dangers
please explain dangers               # Show details about flagged commands
please approve dangers               # Acknowledge dangerous operations
```

**Interactive Safety Workflow:**
```bash
# User requests potentially dangerous operation
please delete all log files older than 30 days

# System detects dangerous patterns and responds
🚨 Safety Alert! I found some spicy commands in your script:

🔴 DANGER: rm -rf /var/log/*.log
   ⚠️  Impact: Irreversible deletion of log files
   ⚠️  Risk: May delete active logs needed by running services
   💡 Suggestion: Use logrotate or move to trash instead

🟡 CAUTION: sudo find /var/log -mtime +30 -delete
   ⚠️  Impact: Requires elevated permissions
   ⚠️  Risk: Could affect system operations
   💡 Suggestion: Test with -ls first to see what would be deleted

Would you like me to:
1. 🛡️  Generate a safer version of this script
2. ✅ Continue with warnings included in the script
3. 🚫 Cancel and suggest alternative approaches
4. 🔧 Customize safety settings

Choose your adventure: _
```

**Enhanced Script Generation:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# 🤖 Generated by Please v5.0
# 🛡️  Safety Level: Balanced
# ⚠️  Contains 2 potentially dangerous operations

echo "🧹 Starting log cleanup process..."

# ✅ SAFE: Check available disk space
df -h /var/log

# 🚨 DANGER ZONE - REVIEW CAREFULLY 🚨
# ⚠️  WARNING: About to delete files permanently!
# ⚠️  IMPACT: Log files older than 30 days will be removed
# ⚠️  REVIEW: Check the file list below before confirming
echo "Files that will be deleted:"
sudo find /var/log -name "*.log" -mtime +30 -ls

read -p "🤔 Continue with deletion? (yes/no): " confirm
if [ "$confirm" = "yes" ]; then
    # 🔴 DESTRUCTIVE OPERATION
    sudo find /var/log -name "*.log" -mtime +30 -delete
    echo "✨ Cleanup completed!"
else
    echo "🛑 Operation cancelled - safety first!"
fi
```

**Implementation Architecture:**
```go
type SafetySystem struct {
    Level           SafetyLevel
    CommandDatabase map[string]DangerousCommand
    Detector        *DangerDetector
    Highlighter     *SyntaxHighlighter

### 5. 📚 Custom Context System (Please Rules)

**Context Directory Structure:**
```
~/.please/
├── config.json
├── contexts/
│   ├── global.md           # Applied to all requests
│   ├── security.md         # Security-focused rules
│   ├── powershell.md       # PowerShell-specific rules
│   ├── bash.md             # Bash-specific rules
│   ├── work.md             # Work environment rules
│   ├── personal.md         # Personal project rules
│   └── aws.md              # AWS-specific rules
└── history/
```

**Example Context Files:**

**security.md:**
```markdown
# Security Context Rules
- Always include input validation
- Use secure file permissions (644 for files, 755 for scripts)
- Never hardcode passwords or API keys
- Include error handling for all network operations
- Prefer secure protocols (HTTPS over HTTP, SFTP over FTP)
- Add logging for security-relevant operations
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
```

**powershell.md:**
```markdown
# PowerShell Best Practices
- Use approved verbs (Get-, Set-, New-, Remove-)
- Include -WhatIf and -Confirm parameters for destructive operations
- Use [CmdletBinding()] for advanced functions
- Include comprehensive error handling with try/catch
- Add parameter validation attributes
- Use Write-Verbose for detailed logging
- Follow PowerShell naming conventions
```

**work.md:**
```markdown
# Work Environment Rules
- All scripts must include company header with author info
- Use company-approved tools and repositories only
- Include audit logging for compliance requirements
- Follow corporate coding standards and style guides
- Add appropriate licensing headers
- Use approved package repositories only
```

**Context Application Logic:**
1. **Global Context**: Always applied if `auto_apply_global: true`

## 🧪 Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Configuration Migration
- **Detect existing** `~/.oohlama/` directory
- **Migrate configuration** from old format to new
- **Preserve user settings** and API keys
- **Create default contexts** based on existing preferences

### Phase 2: Backwards Compatibility
- **Support both** `oohlama` and `please` commands during transition
- **Preserve existing** `ol.bat` alongside new `pls.bat`
- **Migration warnings** to inform users of the transition

### Phase 3: Complete Transition
- **Remove old** command aliases after grace period
- **Clean up** old configuration directories
- **Update documentation** to reflect new commands only

## 🔄 User Experience Flow

### Natural Language Generation
```bash
# User types natural command
please create a backup script for my photos

# System processes
1. Parse arguments: ["create", "a", "backup", "script", "for", "my", "photos"]
2. Join to: "create a backup script for my photos"
3. Check for reserved phrases: None detected
4. Load active contexts: [global, security]
5. Apply contexts to request
6. Send enhanced request to AI provider
7. Generate script with context rules applied
8. Present interactive menu for further actions
```

### Configuration Commands
```bash
# User configures editor
please set editor code

# System processes
1. Detect reserved phrase: "set editor"
2. Parse editor preference: "code"
3. Validate editor availability
4. Update configuration file
5. Confirm change to user
```

### Context Management
```bash
# User creates new context
please create context aws

# System processes
1. Detect reserved phrase: "create context"
2. Create new file: ~/.please/contexts/aws.md
3. Open in configured editor with template
4. Add to available contexts list
```
